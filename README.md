# Guardian [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/A0A577AMK)
A free, open-source, and feature-rich modification for the Attack on Titan Tribute Game.

## Where do I get/download Guardian Mod?
Download "[Launcher.exe](https://aottg.winnpixie.xyz/clients/guardian/Launcher.exe)" and run it!
    - If Windows Smart Defender stops the launcher from running, click "More Info" and then click "Run Anyway", this is an issue I can/will not fix as I do not sign the executable.

## Features
This mod has everything RiceCake's mod (RC mod) has, and much more!

- Improved protection against abusive users!
    - Mod detection could be categorized under this, but I see it as more of a for-fun thing.
- A touched up in-game user-interface.
- In-game Voice Chat!
    - `V` to talk, baskslash (`\`) to open the configuration menu.
- Custom textures/sounds!
    - Help on these are available in the `README.TXT` file found when you download and run Guardian's launcher, or when you extract the ZIP file.
- A *boat-load* of new settings (ESCAPE key to open the configuration menu):
    - **Master Client**
        - AnnounceRoundTime - Announces how many seconds a full round took to finish.
        - AnnounceWaveTime - Announces how many seconds a survival wave took to finish.
        - EndlessTitans - Lets the game never have to restart by spawning new titans when one dies.
        - InfiniteRoom - Stops your room from expiring, thus allowing you to host forever.
        - OGPunkHair - Lets you play like its 2015 again when they still had brightly colored hair.
        - DeadlyHooks - Spice up gameplay by making hooks more 'realistic' by KILLING players instead of grappling to them.
        - BombsKillTitans - Expands upon normal Bomb-PVP to work with titans.
